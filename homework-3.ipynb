    "\n",
    "Evolution is the process by which different living organisms are believed to have developed from earlier forms during the earth's history. The main component that evolves through time is the DNA which is passed on to the next generation. Genetic mutations, variation, and recombination are processes that modify DNA and cause variation in the population. The main drivers of evolution are natural selection and genetic drift that act on this variation. Through time, some characteristics become more common or rare in the population resulting in a change in heritable ones arising over successive generations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though we do not consider viruses to be *living* organisms, they are still subject to evolution. Their genetic material undergoes the same transformations and selection, resulting in new variants and types of viruses.\n",

    "Comparing the characteristics of different organisms allows us to estimate their evolutionary distance. We use genetic material as a proxy for these characteristics. We estimate evolutionary distance as the number of transformation events that would occur for one organism to become genetically identical. In practice, this means aligning genetic sequences and observing the number of transformation events. Performing multiple sequence alignment and calculating pairwise distances gives us a distance matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way of presenting the evolutionary distance between organisms is with a phylogenetic tree. Similar organisms are connected via their common ancestor, even though we do not have genetic data to prove their existence. However, these common ancestors likely existed in the past due to evolution. The most common algorithms for building phylogenetic trees are the UPGMA and Neighbor-Joining algorithms. Many frequentist and Bayesian variations of these are also available online.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once we know the evolution of the virus, we can expand our knowledge about similar viruses to our virus of interest. Our task is implementing the neighbor-joining method, a plotting function, and constructing a phylogenetic tree of coronaviruses. In the last problem, we will see how recombination can seemingly contradict the flow of evolution."

    "## Problem 4: Recombination\n",
    "\n",
    "We tend to think of evolution as a hierarchical process: we have some common ancestor that split into several sub-species through a series of random mutations. However, nothing is that straightforward in biology. There have been well-documented cases of horizontal gene transfer in nature where organisms swap entire chunks of DNA with each other. In viruses, something similar can happen as well. When a cell is infected with multiple virions (potentially different strains of the same virus), a *recombination event* can occur. Recombination occurs during the DNA copying process when, for whatever reason, the copier swaps out the virus template midway with a different template. For instance, we could start copying virus A, and then midway, the copier will switch to virus B, effectively resulting in new virus DNA that has DNA from both viruses A and B.\n",
    "\n",
    "During the start of the global pandemic, there was much confusion about the origins of SARS-CoV-2. We initially thought it came from bats. Then, at some point, people noticed that a critical piece of the spike protein -- the receptor binding domain (RBD) -- was more similar to the sequence of pangolin coronaviruses. This evidence points to recombination. Before the virus jumped to humans, there must have been some host infected with both the Bat RaTG13 coronavirus and the Pangolin coronavirus where this recombination happened.\n",

We will then compare the differences between the two alignments.

Calculate the average number of matching amino acids for each window location in the alignment and plot the resulting similarity sequence. A window size of 100 is a good starting point.
