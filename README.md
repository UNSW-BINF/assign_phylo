# Mapping the family tree

Evolution is the process by which different living organisms are believed to have developed from earlier forms during the earth's history. The main component that evolves through time is the DNA which is passed on to the next generation. Genetic mutations, variation, and recombination are processes that modify DNA and cause variation in the population. The main drivers of evolution are natural selection and genetic drift that act on this variation. Through time, some characteristics become more common or rare in the population resulting in a change in heritable ones arising over successive generations.

Even though we do not consider viruses to be *living* organisms, they are still subject to evolution. Their genetic material undergoes the same transformations and selection, resulting in new variants and types of viruses.

**The tasks of this assignment are:**
- Neighbour joining implementation
- Plotting a phylogenetic tree
- Phylogenetic analysis of coronavirus
- Recombination

Open `phylo_workbook.ipynb` to get started.

## Submission and Grading
There are three types of exercises/answers within each homework:

1. *Coding exercises* require you to implement an algorithm. We will always include Python stubs for the functions you need to implement in a separate file (most often `helper_functions.py`). Please read the function docstrings for expected parameter and return types. Coding problems will be automatically graded with unit tests.

2. *Image answers* require you to generate an image and save the plot to a corresponding file in `<img>.png`. Please ensure that your images have the exact same name as specified in the instructions and are stored in the root folder of the repository (the same folder as the README.md file).

3. *Variable answers* require you to write down your answers into variables. Please be careful that the variables have the exact same name as in the instructions. We will always provide a stub in the notebook. We don't actually run your entire notebooks, we evaluate only the variable we are grading. This means that your variables should be set explicitly. For instance `x = 5 / 3` or `answer_var = x` **will not work** and will receive zero points. All answer variables should be set explicitly e.g. `answer_var = 1.6666` in for this simple example. Please ensure there are no syntax errors in your notebook.


## Environment instructions

You will need Python 3.10 or higher. You will need to install `biopython` for accessing NCBI and `matplotlib` for plotting. You will also need `jupyterlab` to open and run the notebook. You can also use `numpy`, `pandas`, `seaborn`, and `tqdm`. You can install everything necessary by running
```
pip install biopython matplotlib jupyterlab
```

You can start the notebook by running
```
jupyter lab
```
and a browser window should pop open, or you can manually navigate to http://localhost:8888/ in your browser.
